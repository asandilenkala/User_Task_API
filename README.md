# User's and Tasks API

## Overview
This project involves the development of a User's and Tasks API. The API is designed to manage users and their associated tasks, providing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for both users and tasks. The project is divided into several key parts, each focusing on different aspects of API development, database interaction, and documentation.

## Project Structure

### Part 1: API Development
- **Create a New API Project**: The API can be built using either Node.js or C#.
- **Models**:
  - **User**: 
    - ID (Unique identifier)
    - Username (Unique username for the user)
    - Email (User's email address)
    - Password (User's password, securely stored)
  - **Task**:
    - ID (Unique identifier)
    - Title (Title of the task)
    - Description (Detailed description of the task)
    - Assignee (UserID - The user to whom the task is assigned)
    - DueDate (The deadline for task completion)
- **Controllers and Endpoints**:
  - Implement controllers and endpoints to perform CRUD operations for both users and tasks.

### Part 2: Database Interaction
- Choose between:
  - **Entity Framework Core (C#)**
  - **Sequelize (Node.js)**
- Implement repository patterns to handle database interactions for CRUD operations.

### Part 3: Documentation (If C# is used)
- **Swagger Integration**:
  - Integrate Swagger to automatically generate API documentation.
  - Ensure that all API endpoints are documented with appropriate descriptions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** or **.NET Core** (depending on the choice of language)
- **Database**: SQL Server, PostgreSQL, or any preferred relational database.
- **Swagger** (for C# projects)
- **Authentication Libraries**: JWT for bearer token or API key management.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   - For Node.js: `npm install`
   - For C#: Restore NuGet packages.
3. Set up your database and configure connection strings.
4. Run database migrations to set up the models.
5. Start the API server:
   - For Node.js: `npm start`
   - For C#: Run the project using Visual Studio or `dotnet run`.

### Usage
- Use Postman or any API testing tool to interact with the API.
- For C#, access the Swagger documentation at `/swagger`.

### Authentication
- Generate API keys or tokens for secure access to the endpoints.
